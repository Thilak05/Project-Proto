# An AI assisted telemedicine kiosk 
The project focuses on bringing healthcare coverage for all sections of society namely the rural population by bridging the gap of long distance travels and lack of healthcare conciousness among them.

The process flow of our project is as follows:
## Roadmap

- Patient Identification using ABHA QR 

- Vital Analysis (BPM, Temperature, Weight)

- Symptom Analysis using Artifical Intelligence

- Telecommunication means of Doctor Consultation

- Prescription Generation as PDF







## Brief Working
-  Fetched JSON from QR for identifying patients using ABHA identifying

-  Used Eulerian Video Maginification to analyze BPM using generic webcam

-  Used generative AI for symptom analysis by limiting prompts to rectify out of bounds information that may occur

-  Implemented WebRTC means for communication between patient and doctor

-  Final prescription generation in the form of PDF that is automated by fetching data from Firebase realtime database and using Autocrat add-on to generate prescriptions
